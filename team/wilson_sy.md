## About Wilson

Hailing from nearby Mississauga, Wilson has had a passion for software development since middle school. He specializes in backend development, though his industry career goal is to become a project manager. Most recently, he completed a 16-month internship with Kijiji as a BE engineer, working on Google Cloud migration, augmenting the vehicle data pipeline, and experimenting with Elasticsearch improvements. Wilson's work emphasizes code readability and Clean Architecture.

Academically, Wilson is a double major in computer science and linguistics. He is interested in the intersection of linguistics and computer science; such as KR and computational sociolinguistics.

In his free time, he enjoys watching Japanese variety shows, anime, and football (locally called "soccer"). He also loves developing processes to improve personal productivity and support his life-long learning.
