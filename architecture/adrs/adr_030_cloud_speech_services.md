# ADR 030: Use Azure Speech Services for Speech Processing  

## Context  
For the Neurolingo platform, speech processing is a critical feature. It enables users to interact with the system via voice, supporting features such as real-time transcription, pronunciation assessment, and speech-to-text functionality. The primary considerations for selecting a speech processing service include accuracy in transcription and pronunciation assessment, scalability to handle varying workloads efficiently, integration capabilities with existing systems, cost-effectiveness over the long term, and security and compliance with data protection regulations. 

## Options  
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text offers highly accurate transcription and a wide range of language support. Its machine learning models are well-optimized for diverse accents and dialects, making it a strong contender for global applications. However, its integration with the Microsoft Azure-hosted services used by Neurolingo is less seamless, which would increase the complexity of implementation. Additionally, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text tends to be more expensive when scaled for continuous, high-volume use.  

Amazon Transcribe provides powerful transcription capabilities, including support for automated punctuation and speaker diarization. It integrates seamlessly within the AWS ecosystem and is suitable for projects hosted on Amazon's infrastructure. However, because Neurolingo is hosted on Microsoft Azure, using Amazon Transcribe would require significant effort to integrate the services, potentially introducing additional latency. This dependency on cross-platform integration could also complicate maintenance and increase development time.  

Azure Speech Services provides robust speech-to-text functionality and includes dedicate pronunciation assessment tools, which is critical for Neurolingo's language learning use cases. It integrates natively with the Azure App Services that host the Neurolingo platform, simplifying implementation and ensuring low-latency communication between services. Furthermore, Azure Speech Services offers compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, making it a secure option for handling user data. It is also cost-effective within the Azure ecosystem, offering competitive pricing for high-volume workloads.  

## Decision  
We will use Azure Speech Services for Neurolingo's speech processing needs. This decision is based on its native integration with the existing Azure infrastructure, strong capabilities for real-time transcription and pronunciation assessment, and compliance with security regulations. Azure's pricing structure also aligns well with the expected usage patterns of the Neurolingo platform in the future.  

## Status  
Accepted  

## Consequences  
By adopting Azure Speech Services, we gain seamless integration with our Azure-hosted application and benefit from reduced complexity in our architecture. The decision ensures accurate and real-time speech processing for users while maintaining security and compliance with data protection standards.  

This choice ties us very closely to the Azure ecosystem, potentially increasing migration costs if we desire to shift to a different infrastructure provider in the future. Additionally, there may be some limitations in specific edge use cases, such as highly custom models or features that other providers might support better. Overall, this decision aligns with Neurolingo's current needs and infrastructure, while providing scalability for future growth within the confines of Microsoft's cloud offerings.
