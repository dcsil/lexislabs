## ADR 003: Backend Testing - Pytest

## Context

For our MVP, we need a reliable testing framework that ensures the correctness of our backend logic while allowing rapid development. Since we are using Django for our backend, the chosen testing strategy should integrate well with Django, facilitate easy test writing, and support AI-related API integrations.

### Options

1. **Pytest**
   - **Pros**:  
     - Simple and readable syntax for writing tests.  
     - Integrates well with Django via `pytest-django`.  
     - Supports powerful plugins like `pytest-mock` and `pytest-cov`.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires additional setup compared to Django’s built-in test framework.  

2. **Django’s Built-in Test Framework (unittest)**
   - **Pros**:  
     - Native to Django with built-in support.  
     - Well-documented and reliable.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Verbose syntax requiring more boilerplate code.  
     - Slower test execution compared to Pytest.  

3. **FastAPI Testing Tools (TestClient)**
   - **Pros**:  
     - Optimized for API-heavy applications.
   - **Cons**:  
     - Not directly compatible with Django.

## Decision

We have chosen **Pytest** as our primary backend testing framework for our MVP.

---

## Status

**Accepted** - This decision aligns with our goal of rapid MVP development, maintainability, and ensuring test reliability.

---

## Consequences

1. **Short-Term Benefits**:
   - Seamless Django database testing with robust test data management.
   - Easier mocking of APIs and third-party services.

2. **Trade-offs**:
   - Requires initial setup, including installing plugins and configuring test fixtures.

3. **Long-Term Considerations**:
   - Regularly reviewing test coverage reports will help maintain high test quality as the project grows.
