## ADR 001: System Architecture - Monolith

## Context

Our team is building an MVP for NeuroLingo, a language-learning application that integrates AI to provide personalized learning experiences (including pronunciation). Given the scope and timeline of our project, we must decide on a system architecture that enables rapid development, easy collaboration, and straightforward deployment.

### Options

1. **Monolith**  
   - All components (frontend, backend, database) are integrated and run as a single deployment unit.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Simple to set up and maintain for a small team.  
     - Faster development with fewer communication overheads between the various parts.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Limited scalability as the system grows.  
     - Tight coupling between components may lead to complexity over time.  

2. **Microservices**  
   - Split the application into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Greater scalability and flexibility.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Increased time in setting up and maintaining the various components, for a small team. 

3. **Modular Monolith**  
   - Similar to a monolith but with clear boundaries between modules within the same deployment.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Easier to refactor into microservices later if needed and has many of the benefits of a monolith.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires upfront effort in designing an efficient module boundary.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a **Monolith Architecture** for the MVP.

---

## Status

**Accepted** - This decision aligns with our current team size, skills, and project scope.

---

## Consequences

1. **Short-Term Benefits**:
   - Faster development and deployment cycles, which are crucial for meeting our tight project deadlines.
   - Simplified debugging and testing as all components reside within a single codebase.

2. **Trade-offs**:
   - Potential challenges in scaling the application if the system grows significantly beyond the MVP phase.

3. **Long-Term Considerations**:
   - As the application evolves, we will re-evaluate whether transitioning to a modular monolith or microservices architecture is necessary to support scalability and maintainability.
